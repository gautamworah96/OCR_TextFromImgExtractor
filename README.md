# OCR_TextFromImgExtractor

Uses OpenCV to extract regions containing text , contours are then passed on to Tesseract-OCR to extract letter and words.
Currently working well for documents, book and cd covers with high contrast.

Could be used to create an application that automatically adds a book , cd , magazine to your cart.

In this image the text extracted by the program is "Fountain" and "AYN RAND"
